  "summary": "Theme-related updates are present: global CSS tokens updated (light/dark), Tailwind theme extended with new shadows, and multiple pages/layout sections show modernized styling (gradients, shadows, typography). However, the diff also introduces multiple functional additions/behavior changes (e.g., Public Search, To‑Do navigation tab, Excel import/export and filtering enhancements) that were explicitly out of scope as “no new features/routing/auth changes.”",
